# Human-Activity-Recognition
##Goal: 
We seek to develop a human physical activity recognition model based on the UCI Machine learning [Human Activity Recognition dataset ](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

##Project steps:
###1. Exploratory data analysis : 
> Checking the distribution of physical activities available in the data set
> Eliminating activities having very few data points
Number of observations for each activity 

> Distribution of moving vs non moving activities

###2. Predicting moving vs non moving activities:
Logistic regression
Support vector machines
Random Forest

###Feature selection:
Lasso 
Ridge 
PCA

###3. Multiclass classification

Multinomial logistic regression:

Multiclass SVM:
