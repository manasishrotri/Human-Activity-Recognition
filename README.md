# Human Activity Recognition using Smartphone data
##Goal: 
We seek to develop a human physical activity recognition model based on the UCI Machine learning [Human Activity Recognition dataset ](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

## Dataset information

> The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. 
> Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.
> Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope,3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz was captured
> The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

## Project steps:
### 1. Exploratory data analysis : 
> Checking the distribution of physical activities available in the data set
> Eliminating activities having very few data points
Number of observations for each activity 

> Distribution of moving vs non moving activities

### 2. Predicting moving vs non moving activities:
> Logistic regression

> Support vector machines

> Random Forest

### Feature selection:
> Lasso 
> Ridge 
> PCA

### 3. Multiclass classification

> Multinomial logistic regression:

> Multiclass SVM:
